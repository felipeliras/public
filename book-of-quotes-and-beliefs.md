# Book of Quotes and Beliefs
The idea of this page came from the [Book of Beliefs](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/book-of-beliefs.md) by Buster Benson. I liked the idea and started my own book. Here’s what I’ve gathered so far.

## Beliefs

1. There is no failure, only results.
2. Always focus on simplicity.
3. Start small and make improvements as you go.
4. Always try to get a win faster - Focus on the easiest win you can get right now
5. The best work is no work. If it’s not necessary, don’t do it.
6. I feel so much better when people don't know where I am and what I'm doing. 
7. In a company, ensure that before you start selling, multiple people can produce what you're selling with the same quality.
8. The truth is like a lion; you don't have to defend it. Let it loose; it will defend itself.

## Razors
1. Ask how many hours does a task take. When asking the hours people can't tell end of the week for example. Alex Hormozi
2. Ask: Is this a missed opportunity, or is this a problem? And solve all problems. Alex Hormozi
3. The test of "Is this data valuable": When it changes does it changes behavior? If the answer is no, then you don't need to track it. Alex Hormozi
4. The best work is no work. If it’s not necessary, don’t do it. Fábio Akita
5. Ask What would it take? It assumes success. You then work backwards from the reality that you want to create. Alex Hormozi
6. Later you'll be dead. Later is just another word for never. Sahil Bloom
